> ### What is scope ?

 >Scope is the area of code where a variable (or function) exists and is accessible. There are a few different types of scopes in JavaScript: Global Scope, Function Scope and Block Scope.

 >Global Scope is a term used when a variable is declared outside any of the functions i.e the variables should be declared globally.

# What is Local Scope

>When we declare a function it creates its own scope. So, whenever a function is declared it creates its local scope which is limited to that function. So, it means that if you are declared a variable inside a function it’s limited to it.

# Closure 

Closure is one of the most important, and often least understood, concepts in JavaScript. You can think of closure as a way to “remember” and continue to access a function’s scope (its variables) even once the function has finished running.
